# Following the Tutorial Too Far (ftttf)

This is a small pet project evolving from the Rust Book's
[I/O project](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).
The goal is to learn things via unnecessary tweaks for readability, performance,
and preference. For example: no `for` loops! Only iterators and idiomatic error
handling. It was painful, but I learned a lot from it.

You can see what I want to change by searching for the "\@" symbol, e.g. \@perf
for increasing performance. (I had tests at one point, but they disappeared as I
got more and more stuck with iterators; they'll come back when I've cooled off.)
